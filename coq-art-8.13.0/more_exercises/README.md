# More Exercises

This directory contains additional exercises:

- Files `texts/*.v` are Coq scripts with a lot of admitted theorems and/or lacking or
  incomplete definitions. You have just to replace some `Admitted`, `Parameter`, etc.
  with Coq code ended by `Qed` or `Defined`.

  Please feel tree to add any additional lemma or auxiliary function if it helps.
  Please do not require libraries which contain axioms (like `Classical`, `ClassicalChoice`),
  unless explicitely suggested.

- Files `solutions/*.v` contain solutions of the exercises in `texts`.

Please feel free to suggest improvements on our propositions, and new interesting exercises.
